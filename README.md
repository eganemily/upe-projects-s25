# UPE Intern Projects S25
Home for the UPE Intern Projects for the Fall '24 intern class.

## Structure
This repo will contain everyone's projects, so projects should be in their own subfolders, e.g.
```
/ (root)
|-- grace
|    | -- index.html
|    | -- src
|    |    | -- grace_file_1.py
|    |    | -- grace_file_2.py
|-- you
|    | -- (your project files in here!)
```

## Contributing
To create a new project in this repo, follow these steps:  
* _Fork_ this repo to create your own copy.
* _Clone_ your fork to your local machine.
* Locally:
  * Create a new folder in the repo, named after you (or your project).
  * Add a text file named `README.md` to your subfolder.
  * Put whatever info you want (for now) into that `README.md`!
    * e.g. "This is the folder for Grace's intern project!"
* _Add_ your changes to git via `git add .`
* _Commit_ your changes to git via `git commit -m `some message here..."`
* _Push_ your changes to GitHub via `git push`
  * You'll probably have to log in to GitHub here
* You should now see the folder/files you created on GitHub!
* Open a pull request from your fork to the main repo.

To update your project:  
* Make sure to _sync_ your fork (on Github) and run `git pull` locally.
  * Especially important if you're collaborating!
* Make any changes you want to make locally.
* Add/commit/push them to your fork.
* Open a PR from your fork to the main repo.
